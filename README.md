# SYMPHONIC SAVVY

This was a 'painfull' attempt to creat a Classical Mucic Quiz as mandatery 
PP2 project for Code Institute (JavaScript Essentials module). 

I have to admit that I have not been able to materialize my idea of a quiz. I think that is for the most part due to my lack of JavaScript knowledge and not employing progressive enhancement approach on top of a very ambitious idea.

All my efforts were focused on finding a right music, beautiful images, coming up with the fav icon and wedsite's logo, creating wireframes. I have spent a lot of time on the design, but it was wrong approach. I should have started with JavaScript code and then add the design.  

Below is a link just to the some kind of landing page, that was just a mock up of the idea, and not a representation of the final idea.

As I still hade to submit PP2, I decided 
to creat ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK game.

I have tried to change my approach to the project and I have started with 
functional prototype of JavaScript code to make sure that the game works 
(I can select veapon, computer selects weapon, 
the score is displayed, updated and added, etc.). And then I have added layout and styling.
